        <h2>You're Losing Time and Deals to Manual Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Leads come in while you’re driving, at showings, or asleep.</li>
          <li>Follow-ups get delayed, and good prospects go cold.</li>
          <li>Your CRM is full of half-complete info and duplicates.</li>
          <li>You keep copy-pasting the same messages and typing into multiple tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every one of those friction points is stealing time, focus, and revenue from your business.</p>

        <h2>Your Automated Front Desk, Engineered for You</h2>
        <p>
          We build bespoke automations around the tools you already use—so your business
          runs smoother without forcing you into yet another app.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instant lead capture & routing</strong> – every inquiry is logged and tagged.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart follow-up sequences</strong> – personalized texts and emails go out automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Centralized data</strong> – your forms, calendar, email, and CRM actually talk.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin on autopilot</strong> – tasks, notes, and reminders appear where you need them.</li>
        </ul>
