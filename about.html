        <h1>About Daedalus Systems</h1>
        <p>
          Daedalus Systems exists to bring crafted, intelligent automation to small businesses
          that are tired of juggling tools and losing time to manual work.

        <h2>Why “Daedalus”?</h2>
        <p>
          In Greek myth, Daedalus was the master craftsman and engineer—the mind behind intricate
          machines and lifelike automata. He didn’t just build tools. He built systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daedalus Systems continues that tradition: not generic apps, but carefully designed
          workflows that serve real people and real businesses.

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automation should feel like relief, not confusion.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Tools should adapt to your business, not the other way around.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Human relationships stay at the center.</strong> The tech supports them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where We Start</h2>
        <p>
          We begin with your actual day: where leads come from, what you’re doing manually,
          where you’re dropping balls, and what would change your life if it “just happened.”
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, we design systems that are small enough to launch quickly and strong
          enough to scale with you.
