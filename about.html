        <h1>About Daedalus Systems</h1>
        <p>
          Daedalus Systems exists to bring crafted, intelligent automation to small businesses
          that are tired of juggling tools and losing time to manual work. We design systems
          that feel like an extension of how you already work—not another app to fight with.
        </p>

      <!-- Why Daedalus -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Why “Daedalus”?</h2>
        <p>
          In Greek myth, Daedalus was the master craftsman and engineer—the mind behind intricate
          machines and lifelike automata. He didn’t just build tools. He built systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daedalus Systems continues that tradition: not generic apps, but carefully designed
          workflows that serve real people and real businesses.
        </p>

      <!-- Philosophy -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          The tech should feel like a quiet, competent assistant—not a maze. Every project
          we take on is built around a few simple principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automation should feel like relief, not confusion.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Tools should adapt to your business, not the other way around.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Human relationships stay at the center.</strong> The tech supports them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Where We Start -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Where We Start</h2>
        <p>
          We begin with your actual day: where leads come from, what you’re doing manually,
          where you’re dropping balls, and what would change your life if it “just happened.”
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, we design systems that are small enough to launch quickly and strong
          enough to scale with you.
        </p>

        <h2>Let’s Talk</h2>
        <p>
          If this sounds like how you want your business to run, we can map your workflows
          and show you what a tailored automation system could look like.
